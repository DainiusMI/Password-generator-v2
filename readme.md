# PASSWORD GENERATOR V2
This is a "PREMIUM" challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).so style guides or images used in it were accessible for me.

### REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### RESULTS:
- Responsive design was not implemented to this project
- The design ideas for all interactive elements were unknown to me so I "winged" them
